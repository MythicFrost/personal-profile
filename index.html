                    <p>
                        I was born in Sydney in 1991 and when I was about 4 years old my family moved up to the Gold Coast and I've been living here ever since. I was homeschooled until about age 16.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy spending time with friends, PC gaming, rollerskating, ice skating and tennis. As a young teen I wanted to be a professional tennis player, however I had to pull out at age 16; I continue to play socially.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            I have been learning Hebrew for 7 years and speak it reasonably well, and I have dabbled in Japanese; I would like to reach near native fluency in both languages one day. Other languages also interest me.

                    <p>I did some research prior to choosing to come to RMIT. I believe that IT and programming are a big part of RMIT's focus; I thought that the degree would be well designed and structured and I have not been disappointed so far.</p>

                    <h3 class="headline">What do I expect to learn</h3>

                    <p>As I have been primarily self taught, there certainly will be gaps in my understanding of the industry and in the particular areas where I have focused my attention and I would like to fill these gaps. During my studies I expect I will gain a more broad understanding of the IT industry as a whole.</p>

                    <h3 class="headline">When did my interest in IT start?</h3>

                    <p>I was first introduced to programming when I was 13 or 14. I played a game called Warcraft 3 that allowed you use a visual kind of programming language to create new maps for it via an editor; this piqued my interest in programming.</p>

                    <p>Not long after, I tackled HTML and then learned PHP & Javascript. I moved on to Actionscript, and then into Visual Basic .NET where I spent a lot of time and really developed some fundamental programming skills. Consequently I am familiar with C#.</p>

                    <p>Eventually I switched to a Mac and decided to learn Objective C and later Swift -- I built a few iPhone apps over a period of a couple of years; finally I came full circle and decided to brush up on my web language skills, learn CSS & Wordpress, and then I started a small website design & development business.</p>

                    <p>Whilst running my business I have continued learning about design and development, as well as client interactions, sales, and so forth.</p>

            <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
            <p>I am comfortable in the field of website design & development and enjoy it; however I am interested in a variety of different fields in IT which I hope to gain a broader understanding of as I proceed with the degree.</p>

                            <p>This job really appeals to me because it allows me to work from home.</p>
                            <p>It's very convenient and suits my lifestyle; however I am not opposed to working on-site as I think the benefits of interacting with the rest of the team in-person are a plus.</p>
                            <p>I like the company's goals (online education) and I feel that I meet many of the requirements; 6 years experience (in my own business), strong experience with Wordpress, HTML, CSS, Javascript & PHP. </p>
                            <p>I have no experience with AWS so that would be something I would need to learn.</p>

                                <p>I have worked with many clients over the years, and I feel my communication skills are good.</p>

                                <p>The listing mentions flexible daily working hours and a good environment with an opportunity for growth and learning which suits my goals.</p>

            <h3>Other interesting fields</h3>
            <p>Some other fields outside of website development that I think would be interesting to work in include: Business Analytics and/or IT Consulting; the reason being, I enjoy looking for software and other ways to improve the systems and methods I use, to make them more efficient, more convenient, and faster. I have done this to some degree in both my own business as well as the family business I work in.</p>
            <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
            <p>Data Analytics is an interesting field. I have some experience with Google Advertising and Google Analytics, so I am familiar with putting together information and using it to make decisions; I would regularly do this in an advertising campaign to determine if my ads or keywords were successful and if I was profitting from the campaign.</p>
            <p>Software Development & Infrastructure Development, Database Management, Network Management and Support also could be fulfilling roles that I am interested in.</p>
