                <p class="animation-fade-in animation-delay-15">
                    I am 29 years old and from the Gold Coast, Queensland. I was born in Sydney, and my family moved up to the Gold Coast when I was about 4.

                <p class="animation-fade-in animation-delay-20">
                    I was homeschooled until age 16 and have always had a passion for languages of all kinds (including programming languages.)

                    About 7 years ago I began learning Hebrew and speak quite fluently; I would like to reach native level fluency one day. I have also learned a little bit of Japanese, and have an interest in many other languages such as Arabic, Chinese, German, Korean, and many more.
                </p>
                <p class="animation-fade-in animation-delay-25">
                    Besides learning language, my hobbies include: gaming, rollerskating, ice skating and tennis. As a young teen I wanted to be a professional tennis player, however due to health reasons I had to stop at age 16; I have continued to play socially for many years.

                    <h3 class="headline">Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>

                    <p>Prior to starting study at RMIT I researched several different different universities; I chose to study here because I understand that IT and programming are a large part of the university's focus, thought the degree would be well structured, thorough and informative - I have not been disappointed thus far.</p>

                    <h3 class="headline">What do I expect to learn?</h3>

                    <p>As I have primarily been self taught, there will certainly be gaps in my understanding of the IT industry as a whole. I would like to fill in these gaps and gain a deeper, broader understanding of the industry.</p>

                    <p>In particular, I am interested in learning more about databases, security, networks, various programming languages and other IT related topics with which I am not familiar.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3 class="headline">When did my interest in IT start?</h3>
                    <p>I was first introduced to programming when I was 13 or 14; I played a game called Warcraft 3 which had a map editor that allowed you to use a visual kind of programming language to create new maps for the game; this is what initially piqued my interest in programming.</p>

                    <p>Not long after, I decided to learn HTML and then PHP & Javascript after that. I moved on to Actionscript 2.0 in Flash, and then into Visual Basic .NET which I used for several years – during this time I developed a lot of fundamental programming skills. Through VB.NET I was gradually introduced to C++, and I have also used a little bit of C#.</p>

                    <p>Eventually I switched from a PC to a Mac and decided to learn Objective C and later Swift - I built a few iPhone apps over a period of a couple of years; finally I came full circle and decided to brush up on my web language skills, learn CSS & Wordpress, and then I started a small website design & development business.</p>

                    <p>Whilst running my business I have continued learning about design and development, improving my knowledge of the languages that I use, learning better processes, as well as improving my interactions with clients.</p>

            <h2>My interests in IT</h2>
            <p>I have many interests in IT that include gaming, VR, AI, computer hardware, blockchain, website development & web technologies; I'm also interested in learning more about networks, databases, and security.</p>
            <div class="grid-container">
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Artificial Intelligence & Datasets</h3>
                    <p class="mb-10"><strong>AI</strong> has numerous applications across the entire IT industry. I recall reading an article about an AI that was being used in a program to help upscale images; it was able to produce a much better result than a normal program by "figuring out" how the scene should look.</p>
                    <span>See this link for an example:</span>
                    
                    <a class="ai-upscaler-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://letsenhance.io/">https://letsenhance.io/</a>
                    <p>Another aspect of <strong>AI</strong> is <strong>datasets</strong>; gathering an enormous amount of information on a given subject and making predictions and suggestions based on that information. We see AI working in the stock and crypto markets - trying to predict where the price is going next.</p>
                    <h3>Computer Hardware</h3>
                    <p>I really like computer hardware - I built my own PC, and often find myself reading reviews, benchmarks and even in-depth articles on various components including CPUs, GPUs, RAM, and SSDs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Gaming & VR</h3>
                    <p>Gaming is definitely a huge interest for me; I appreciate the artwork, the coding, the stories, and all the technologies that bring all these elements together. I also greatly enjoy the social aspect of it and play with friends often.</p>
                    <p>I've always thought it would be amazing to create games. I have amassed a number of project ideas for mobile games over the years that I would like to bring to fruition one day.</p>

                    <p><strong>VR in gaming</strong> is also very interesting (although it has other applications as well of course) and I look forward to seeing how the space evolves. In my opinion, it's still very much in its infancy; however, the technology is continually improving in various areas such as tracking, refresh rate, and resolution. I believe adoption will continue to increase strongly.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Blockchain</h3>
                    <p>I think blockchain is a crucial topic to understand; the ability to program on the blockchain is a sought after skill which will become more and more in demand in the future. I want to learn how to create DApps, SmartContracts, and build on top of the Ethereum network and perhaps other networks as well.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Security</h3>
                    <p>A very important topic across many different fields is security. Whether it's for a program or for a website, protecting critical information is paramount; during the degree I would like to increase my knowledge in security and of best practices (particularly in programs and in websites.)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Website Development</h3>
                    <p>Website development is definitely a passion of mine; I have been servicing clients for a number of years and really enjoy creating different designs and functionality with code, and assisting clients with their online presence.</p>
                    <p>The web and all its technologies are just continually evolving, such as the HTML and CSS standards, becoming more powerful and functional; it's a very interesting space to be in.</p>

            <p><strong>Data Analytics</strong> is an interesting field. I have some experience with Google Advertising and Google Analytics, so I am familiar with putting together information and using it to make decisions; I would regularly do this in an advertising campaign to determine if my ads or keywords were successful and if I was profiting from the campaign.</p>
            <p>Software Development & Infrastructure Development, Database Management, Network Management and Support also could be fulfilling roles that I am interested in.</p>

                    <p>
                        According to the test results I am 58% introverted, 62% observant, 69% feeling, 69% judging, and 67% assertive.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am introverted but I do also enjoy spending time with people. I wouldn't say I prefer solitary activities, but being isolated doesn't bother me; consequently, I think a remote working environment suits me well.</p>
                    <p>Decisiveness, thoroughness, attention to detail, structure, being organised and executing plans are all traits I value; although there are certainly times when I have difficulty making tough decisions. I am self-assured and I do not lose my temper easily; however, I do get stressed every now again.</p>
                    <p>I agree with much of what the Assertive Defender personality profile says. I enjoy helping people, being friendly, and I am both reliable and patient. I often go above and beyond what is required. I am always concerned with the feelings of other people and I do not like causing offense. I believe in forgiveness, compassion and moving on.</p>
                    <p>The article discusses that Defenders' desires to help can be abused as they do not want to say no or cause an incident. Personally, I am willing to go out of my way to help, however I have no issue in speaking up if I feel someone is taking advantage of my willingness to help.</p>

                    <p>
                        I agree with the assessment that I am a visual learner. I often like to watch things being done in order to obtain a clear understanding of what to do; I find oral explanations by themselves are not nearly as effective as physically seeing how something is done. Prior to building my own PC, I watched 5-6 hours of "how to build a PC" tutorials on YouTube.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking at pictures, videos, or even watching someone else do something helps me greatly in understanding how to do it.

                    <p>
                        It might be a good idea to form a team with people who are more aural or kinesthetic learners; that way the team has a diverse group of people who analyse problems and find solutions in different ways and help the overall effectiveness of team's goal.

                                These results describe me well. I try to think of others and to understand their opinions and views, and I have the mindset that I do not need to agree with them in order to get along with them. I enjoy helping people and providing support.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a team, I am quick to try and help the other team members if they run into a problem, particularly if I am well versed with the particular issue that they have.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I think I can handle any team environment well. The only circumstance I could anticipate being difficult is if my team members were to be inconsiderate or lazy; the former is easier to address - I can politely explain the situation, the latter however is trickier to approach. If I can help a team member who is particularly efficient at their work to get past certain obstacles, I think that's great for the team's work overall.

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>My project idea is an app to supplement bible study. Initially the project would begin as a web app that works on both desktop and smartphone; following that, an app for Android and then for iOS would be released.</p>
                    <p>There are many books in the bible, with many chapters and verses across a vast range of topics; this app's purpose is to make it easy to keep lists of scriptures sorted by user created tags (topics.) It also adds an aspect of community to it as the user can see what tags and scriptures that others have added.</p>
                    <p>The app will display a screen of tags (E.G., "law", "mercy", "love", "messianic prophecy", "dietary laws") that have been added by both themselves and other users. When clicking on a tag (for example "love") it will show all the scriptures that have had that tag added to them.</p>
                    <p>The app will also display a screen where the user can look up scriptures and apply tags that they've created.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>Christianity is the largest religious group in the world with 2.3 billion believers as of 2015. (Hackett and Mcclendon, 2017)</p>
                    <p>This app may appeal to those who are interested in improving their knowledge of the bible, debating or studying specific topics, or even just randomly exploring other topics with which they may not be very familiar.</p>
                    <p>I myself read the bible very often and would appreciate being able to use this app to keep track of scriptures on particular topics for both debating and studying purposes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item project-item">
                    <h3 class="project-desc-headline">Description</h3>
                    <div class="grid-container">
                        <div class="grid-item">
                            <p>As stated above, the app allows users to create their own tags which they can then apply to various scriptures. They can then view all the scriptures associated with a given tag.</p>
                            <p>The user can browse tags and scriptures added within the community, or just their own tags and scriptures that they've added.</p>
                            <p>There is no need to sign up to use the app - a user can view community tags and tagged scriptures; The benefits to signing up include being able to create your own tags, to tag scriptures, and to read a translation of the scriptures (E.G., the NIV).</p>
                            <p>Bible related ads at the top of the app will cover necessary hosting costs. There is no fee for the user to sign up; however, ads could be removed with a monthly subscription.</p>
                            <p>Additional considerations that could be taken into account are additional bible translations, support for different languages, a discussion forum or "prayer request" submissions section.</p>
                            <p>The app(s) would include functionality to send you an email (for the web app) or a push notification (for the Android and iOS apps) on the verses that you have tagged.</p>
                            <p>Licensing fees and hosting fees are potential difficulties that may need to be addressed.</p>

                            <h4>Some key features:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Users can quickly add or merge community tags and scriptures to their own.</li>
                                <li>Users can upvote or downvote tags based on their relevance to the related scriptures, improving accuracy. (This would not affect a user's personal tags, only community tags).</li>
                                <li>Users can create a list of scriptures which is immutable to all but the author; the list should describe a narrative on a topic. These lists could be randomly featured on the site, allowing for upvotes to indicate interesting content.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                    <p>For the web app, I would utilise a front-end framework such as Angular and a server-side language such as PHP. For the database I would use MySQL. Additional technologies (or alternatives) might include Typescript, Node.js, React, or Vue.</p>
                    <p>Visual Studio Code and Brackets are great editors for many of these languages. For building the Android app I would use Java in Android Studio; for iOS I would use Swift in XCode.</p>
                    <p>A suitable ads framework for each platform (web, iOS, Android) would be required.</p>
                    <p>I already have the necessary devices at my disposal for development & testing: Windows PC, Mac, iPhone and Android smartphone.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Required Skills</h3>
                    <p>An assortment of programming skills will be required to produce the apps, including: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Javascript frameworks, MySQL, Java, Swift.</p>
                    <p>Also, the data architecture will be incredibly important as the app(s) will need to categorise and structure the tags, scriptures, and their associations efficiently in a database.</p>
                    <p>I already possess many of these core skills, however I am not familiar with the aforementioned frameworks for the front-end, so I will need to follow some tutorials and courses.</p>
                    <p>I will also need to liaise with companies to procure licenses for their bible translations. I have already contacted the company responsible for licensing the NIV.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3 class="project-outcome-headline">Outcome</h3>
                    <p>If the project is successful, it will provide an easy and fun way for users to learn and keep track of scriptures on a variety of different topics. It has potential to expand in the future to other languages or additional versions of the bible.</p>
                    <p>An additional benefit is forming a community of people interested in bible study whom are actively contributing to the site just by using it; you may stumble across community tags for different topics you've not studied before, or see scriptures you haven't read before that are related to topics you're interested in.</p>
                    <p>The project would also demonstrate my capabilities; it would be a great item to have in my portfolio.</p>
